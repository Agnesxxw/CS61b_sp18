# Time Complexity

### Intuitive Simplification 1: Consider only the Worst Case
### Intuitive Simplification 2: Restrict Attention to One Operation
>* Pick some representative operation to act as a proxy for overall runtime.The operation we choose can be called the “cost model.”
### Intuitive Simplification 3: Eliminate Low Order Terms
### Intuitive Simplification 4: Eliminate Multiplicative Constants
## Simplified model
>* Choose our cost model (representative operation we want to count).

## Formalizing Order of Growth
>* Given some function, Q(N), we can apply our last two simplifications to get the order of growth of Q(N).
## Big-Theta
R(N)∈Θ(f(N)) -> k ~1~⋅f(N)≤ R(N) ≤ k~2~⋅f(N)
use the Θ symbol in the place of “order of growth” (i.e. worst case runtime: \Theta(N^2^)Θ(N^2^))

## Big O
R(N)∈O(f(N)) 
R(N)≤k~2~⋅f(N) 
Observe that this is a looser condition than Big Theta since Big O does not care about the lower bound.
## Summary
1. Choose a representative operation
2. Let C(N) = count of how many times that operation occurs, as a function of N.
3. Determine order of growth f(N)for C(N), i.e. C(N)∈Θ(f(N))
4. Often (but not always) we consider the worst case count.
5. If operation takes constant time, then R(N)∈Θ(f(N))
