# Limitation of SLList
1. cnanot insert in the middle
2. slow to add at the end
# DLList
1. delete last node -> find the second last pointer -> find the third last ……
2. each node has both prev and next-> double linked list
3. Two sentinals or circle linked list
# To create linked list in other type
### 1. add anything behind class: **<>is like a type parameter**
```java
public class SLList<LochNess>{ //<>is like a place holder to place any type that is not decided at the time SSLList is  created
```

### 2. Remember to change all the types into LochNess for example
```java
public StuffNode sentinel; // the first item is at sentinel.next if its exists */
	private int size;

	public class StuffNode{
		public LochNess item;
		public StuffNode next;

		public StuffNode(LochNess i, StuffNode n){
		item = i;
		next = n
		}
	}
```
### 3. in the main, replace lochenss as the type you want
```java
public static void main(String[] args){
		SLList<String> L = new SLList<>[''bones'']; //<String> will replace <lochness> everywhere, and tells the type now is string
		L.addfirst('thugs')
	}
```
# Arrays
### 1. a fixed integer length 
### 2. All the boxes hold the same type
```java
y = new int[3]; // will have an defalt value 0
x = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5};//size is 5
int[] w = {9,10,11,12,13};// cannot use it with already declared variables
```
### 3. once lose the reference -> never draw back
### 4. copy
```java
System.arraycopy(b,0,a,3,2)// copy b to a from b[0] to a[3], then go further 2 copies. so b[0]->a[3], b[1]->a[4]. if a changes, b won't change.
a[0] = b[0];//if a[0]changes, b[0] will change, since they point to the same box
```

## 2D Arrays
### 1. define an 2d array
```java
int[][] pascalsTriangle; // array of int array reference
pascalsTriangle = new int[4][];//create four boxes, each can store an int array reference
int[] rowZero = pascalsTriangle[0];
pascalsTriangle[0] = new int[]{1};
pascalsTriangle[1] = new int[]{1,1};
pascalsTriangle[2] = new int[]{1,2,1};
……
int rowTwo = pascalsTriangle[2];
rowTwo[1] = -5 // this changes the pascalsTriangle[2][1] from 2 to -5
```
```java
matrix = new int[4][];
matrix = new int[4][4];//actually create five arrays
```
## Arrays & classes
### 1. both organize bunch of memory box
### 2. classes: can different type, array cannot
### 3. simpler access to each element in array
