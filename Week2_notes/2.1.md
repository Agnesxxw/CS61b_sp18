# 1. Bits
>* Information is stored in memory as binary numbers
>* Each Java type has a different way to interpret the bits, when define variables, computer sets aside exactyly enough bits to hold.
>* Java creates an internal table that **maps** each variable name to a location, doesn't write anything into the reserved boxes;must initialized before access
>* The Golden Rule of Equals(GRoE): = -> copy bits
# 2.Variable type
>* Primitive types: int, long, float, double, boolean, char; pass **values** directly
>* Everything else; including arrays, is **reference type(arrow)**, box and pointer notation; pass **address**
>* First allocate box each instance variable
```java
public static class test{
	public int weight;
	public double tuskSize;
}
```
>* Then constructor  usually fills every such box with some other value(doesn'y have to)
```java
public static class test{
	public int weight;//32bits
	public double tuskSize;//64bits
	public test(int w, double ts){
		weight = w;
		tuskSize = ts;
	}
}
```
>* When instantiate variables, find the 32+64bits and put the value inside 
```java
new test(1000, 8.3) // new returns where you put these values(address)
```
>* Declaration for reference type:
>>* exactly 64 bits -> return 64 bits address of the instance of that class by "new"
```java
test a;
a = new test(1000, 8.3);
test b;
b = a;// b points to the same box as a, so when a changes, b changes.
```
>* Parameter Passing : GRoE, pass by value

# 3. Arrays
>* Object. So intantiated using **new** keyword
>* Declaration: create a 64 bits for array address
```java
int[] a; // Declaration, no object is instantiated here
```
>* Instatiation, assignment. **new** command will return the address
```java
int[] a = new int[]{0,1,2,95,4}// declaration, instatiation, assignment together. Only copy.
```
Note: Instatiated objects can be lost! Will be cover by reassign value
# 4. IntList and Linked Data Structure
1. Create a list
```java
public static class test{
	public int first; //data
	public test rest; // pointer to the next element(box) 
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		test L = new test();
		L.first = 5;
		L.rest = null;

		L.rest = new test();
		L.rest.first = 10;

		L.rest.rest = new test();
		L.rest.rest.first = 15;

	}
}
```
**or**
```java
public static class test{
	public int first;
	public test rest;
	
	public test(int f , test r){
		first = f;
		rest = r;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		test L = new test(15, null); // end element
		L = new test(10,L); //before end
		L = new test(5, L) // backwards
		//generate a linked list: 5 -> 10 ->15
	}
}
```
2. size method
>* **this** method:Within an instance method or a constructor, **this** is a reference to the current objectâ€” the object whose method or constructor is being called. You can refer to any member of the current object from within an instance method or a constructor by using **this**.
```java
/**  recursion to get the size */
	public int size(){
		if(rest == null){
			return 1;
		}
		return 1 + this.rest.size();
	}
```
```java
/** iteration to get the size */
	public int iterativeSize(){
		test p = this;
		int totalSize = 0;
		while(p != null){
			totalSize += 1;
			p = p.rest;
		}
		return totalSize;
```
3. get method
```java
/** get method to get ith element of the list */
	public int get(int i){
		if(i == 0){
			return first;
		}
		return rest.get(i - 1);
	}
```
