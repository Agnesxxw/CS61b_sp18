# 1. Automatice Conversions
## Type
A. Object
B. Number, **Boolean,Character**
C. Number: **Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double**
>* One particular feature of Java is that we cannot provide a primitive type as an actual type argument for generics,e.g. ```ArrayDeque<int>``` is a syntax error.Instead, we use ```ArrayDeque<Integer>```.
>* For rach primitive type, use the corresponding reference type are called "wrapper classes"
## Autoboxing and Unboxing
1. Java can implicitly convert between primitive and wrapper types,Java will automatically "box" and "unbox" values between a primitive type and its corresponding reference type
2. Java will automatically "box" and "unbox" values between a primitive type and its corresponding reference type
3. Arrays are never autoboxes or auto-unboxed, if you want to copy one array, you have to do it mannualy
4. Additionally, wrapper types use much more memory than primitive types. On most modern comptuers, not only must your code hold a 64 bit reference to the object, but every object also requires 64 bits of overhead used to store things like the dynamic type of the object.

## Summary
1、Integer: int's warapper type，int: primitive type 
2、Integer must be **instantiated** before used，int doesn't need to
3、Integer is the **reference to object**，when ```new Integer```，it generates a **pointer** towards this object(address)；int just store the data directly 
4、Integer's initialization is **null**，int' initialization is **0**

# 2. Widening
1. Java will also automatically widen a primitive if needed.
2. If you want to go from a wider type to a narrower type, you must manually cast
```java
double x = 20;
blahInt((int) x);
```
# 3. Immtability
An immutable data type is a data type whose instances cannot change in any observable way after instantiation.
```java
public class Date {
    public final int month;
    public final int day;
    public final int year;
    private boolean contrived = true;
    public Date(int m, int d, int y) {
        month = m; day = d; year = y;
    }
}
// myday.month = xxxxx this won't work
```
>* ```String``` objects in Java are immutable. No matter what, if you have an instance of ```String```, you can call any method on that ```String```, but it will remain completely unchanged. 
>* Mutable datatypes include objects like ```ArrayDeque``` and ```Planet```. We can add or remove items from an ```ArrayDeque```
>* Any data type with **non-private variables** is mutable, unless those variables are declared **final** (this is not the only condition for mutability -- there are many other ways of defining a data type so that it is mutable)
>* **Declaring a reference as final does not make the object that reference is pointing to immutable**
>> The deque variable is final and can never be reassigned, but the array deque object its pointing to can change! ArrayDeques are always mutable! **Be careful with reference type**
```java
public final ArrayDeque<String>() deque = new ArrayDeque<String>();
```
>* Using the Reflection API, it is possible to make changes even to private variables! 

## Advantages:
1. Prevents bugs and makes debugging easier because properties cannot change ever
2. You can count on objects to have a certain behavior/trait
## Disadvantages
1. You need to create a new object in order to change a property

# 3. ArrayMap
### Basic implementation
```java
public class ArrayMap<K, V> {// generic type variable

    private K[] keys;
    private V[] values;
    private int size;
    public ArrayMap(){
	keys = (K[]) new Object[100];
	values = (V[]) new Object[100];
	size = 0;
    }
	...
}
```
When instantiate the, . we provid what are called actual type arguments
```java
ArrayMap<Integer, Integer> isMap = new ArrayMap<Integer, Integer>();
isMap.put(2, 5);
int expected = 5;
assertEquals(expected, isMap.get(2));// ?
...
```
What automatic conversions are needed to call assertEquals(Object, Object)?
>* box up int to Integer,then assertEquals(Integer,Integer), they are both Object.(Integer to Object has nothing happend in runtime, so may not count as one conversion. **But Java counts**). So:
```java
assertEquals((Integer)expected, isMap.get(2));
```
# 4. Generic Methods
```java
/** returns the value if the key exsited in the sim */
public static <k, v> v get(Map61B<k, v> sim, k key){//Only make this method generitic, a map containing k and v called sim, and the key. return type is v
  if (sim.containsKey(key)){
	return sim.get(key);}
  }
  return null;
}
```
## A Better Type Upper Bound: Comparable
return the maximum of all keys
```java
public static <K extends Comparable<K>, V> K maxKey(ArrayMap<K, V> map) {// In order to make k comparable, otherwise, K’s don’t necessarily have a compareTo method.
    List<K> keylist = map.keys();
    K largest = keylist.get(0);
	for (K k : keylist) {
        if (k.comparable(largest) > 0) { // do not know what is k, so don't know if it can use compareTo method
            largest = k;
        }
    }
	return largest;
}

```
>* Here, It's not a statement of fact, but a definiation of K, making sure it's a subclass of comparable
>> Can use ```extends``` keyword as a **type upper bound**. Only allow use on ArrayMaps with OurComparable keys.
>> Any ArrayMap you give me must have actual parameter type that is a subtype of OurComparable.

```java
public static <K extends Comparable<K>, V> K maxKey(ArrayMap<K, V> map){
}
```
## Dealing with Types We Don’t Care about
>* We don’t care about the actual type, since we never used V anywhere.
```java
 ArrayMap<Dog, Double> am2 = new ArrayMap<Dog, Double>();
  am2.put(new Dog("frank"), 10);
  am2.put(new FrenchDog("francis", 20);
  MapHelper.allBark(am2);
```
```java
public static void allBark(ArrayMap<Dog, Double> am) {//only for ArrayMaps from Dog to Double.
   List<Dog> dogs = am.keys();
   for (int i = 0; i < dogs.size(); i += 1) {
       dogs.get(i).bark();
   }
}
```
>*1.  Can add generic parameter to method to fix.

```java
public static <V> void allBark(ArrayMap<Dog, V> am) {

   List<Dog> dogs = am.keys();
   for (int i = 0; i < dogs.size(); i += 1) {
       dogs.get(i).bark();
   }
}
```
>* 2. Use white card to fix
>> Avoids need to iterate through list using indices.
```java
public static void allBark(ArrayMap<Dog, ?> am) {
   for (Dog d : am.keys()) {
       d.bark(); 	
   }
}

```
## Covariance
Arrays are covariant in Java, but generic types are invariant.
>* A List<FrenchDog> is NOT a List<Dog>.
```java
public static void allBark(ArrayMap<? extends Dog, ?> am) {
//Code never uses K so need to actually specify a generic type.
   for (Dog d : am.keys()) {
       d.bark(); 	
   } 
}
```
