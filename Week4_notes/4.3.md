# Subtype Polymorphism
1. In Java, polymorphism refers to how objects can have many forms or types. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism relates to how an object can be regarded as an instance of its own class, an instance of its superclass, an instance of its superclass's superclass, and so on.
2. **Provide a single interface to a entities of different types**
>* Explicit HoF Approach
>* Subtype Polymorphism Approach
## Inheritance
```java
public interface OurComparable {
    public int compareTo(Object o);
}
public static OurComparable max(OurComparable[] items) {
    int maxDex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < items.length; i += 1) {
        int cmp = items[i].compareTo(items[maxDex]);
        if (cmp > 0) {
            maxDex = i;
        }
    }
    return items[maxDex];
}
public int compareTo(Object o) {
    Dog uddaDog = (Dog) o; //compareTo takes in any arbitrary Object o, we have to cast the input to a Dog to make our comparison using the size instance variable
    return this.size - uddaDog.size;
}
```
## Comparables
1. lots of biult-in classes implement Comparable
2. 2. mant libraries use the comparable interface
3. avoid need for casts

## Comparator
>* natural order
```java
import java.util.Comparator;

public class Dog implements Comparable<Dog> {
    ...
    public int compareTo(Dog uddaDog) {
        return this.size - uddaDog.size;
    }

    private static class NameComparator implements Comparator<Dog> {//it's static type, we do so because we do not need to instantiate a Dog to get a NameComparator
        public int compare(Dog a, Dog b) {
            return a.name.compareTo(b.name);
        }
	public static comparator<Dog> getNameComparator() {
            return new NameComparator();
        }
    }

    public static Comparator<Dog> getNameComparator() {
        return new NameComparator();
    }
}
```
# Comparable and Comparator Summary
>* The helping function is sometimes called a "callback"
>* some languages handle this using explicit function passing
>* In Java, we generally do this by wrapping up the needed function in an inetrface
>* Comparable compares 'myself' with another; while comparator compares two other objects
